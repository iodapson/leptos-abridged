<h2>Leptos Abridged</h2>

This is a compressed version of [the Leptos frontend framework documentation](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/) powered by the programming language, [Rust](https:///www.rust-lang.org/learn).

This book focuses more on the code to get things done. It does not cover Leptos specific concepts in detail. Rather, it extracts and sometimes annotates code examples from the official Leptos documentation in the context of frontend development.

You can use it a quick reference material, in complement with the official leptos documentaion for a more detailed Leptos concepts explainer.

### Conventions Used

- Wherever you see `{{_}}`, it represents a placeholder text for an actual value, variable, or expression. The text inside the position of `_` should be used or changed in-place of `{{_}}`.
  For example, if you see `{{my_chosen_value_name}}`, it should be replaced with `your_chosen_value_name`.

### Leptos Examples

- You can find concrete examples of Leptos mini-apps from the official documentation on [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/leptos/latest/leptos/#learning-by-example) for Leptos.
  _Enjoy!_
