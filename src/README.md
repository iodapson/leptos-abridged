<h2>Leptos Abridged</h2>

This is a compressed version of [the Leptos frontend framework documentation](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/) powered by the programming language, [Rust](https:///www.rust-lang.org/learn).

This book focuses more on the code to get things done. It does not cover Leptos specific concepts in detail. Rather, it extracts and sometimes annotates code examples from the official Leptos documentation in the context of frontend development.

You can use it a quick reference material, in complement with the official leptos documentaion for a more detailed Leptos concepts explainer.

Enjoy!
